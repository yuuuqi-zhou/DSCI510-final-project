st.markdown('4. What did you set out to study?')
st.markdown('- I am currently exploring the intersection between the Spotify Most Streamed Songs list and the Billboard Songs Ranking for the year 2023. My hypothesis suggests that there is a significant overlap in the musical characteristics and trends of songs appearing on both lists. Furthermore, I propose that the popularity of songs on Spotify, as measured by their streaming numbers, may have a discernible impact on their rankings on the Billboard chart.')
st.markdown('5. What did you Discover/what were your conclusions?')
st.markdown("- After my analysis, roughly speaking, Spotify and Billboard's rankings in 2023 share similar trends and the same important factors.")
st.markdown('6. What difficulties did you have in completing the project?')
st.markdown('- I think the most difficult part was to analyze the limited data as exhaustively as possible, and even though I knew that assumptions can fail I put some effort into examining the connections between the data and figuring out what kind of charts were representative in order to make the project more meaningful.')
st.markdown('7. What skills did you wish you had while you were doing the project?')
st.markdown('- I ran into a lot of difficulties with the code while making this webapp, and basically solved a lot of them by learning on my own, so my difficulty became studying the data itself: I wanted to have more solutions to regression problems for myself so that I could explore the relationship between specific independent and dependent variables.(Of course more data is also needed)')
st.markdown('8. What would you do “next” to expand or augment the project?')
st.markdown('- I first needed access to a large amount of similar data, which would enable me to build a more accurate regression model with room to test it. Also for the selection of data I would like to get better quality and more representative ones, such as the streams of the song over a fixed period of time after its release as I mentioned earlier.')
